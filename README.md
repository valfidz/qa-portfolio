# QA Portfolio – Naufal Hafizh Nugraha

This repository contains my Quality Assurance (QA) portfolio, created to demonstrate skills in test case design, bug reporting, and test documentation.  
Although my background is in backend development, I actively apply structured QA methodologies such as functional testing, defect reporting, and system analysis to ensure product quality.
